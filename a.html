      <h1>A</h1>
      <h5>Accent Fallay: This fallacy occurs when the meaning of a word, sentence or whole idea changes based on where the accent falls.
        A good example of this is seen in the movie 'My Cousin Vinny'
        when Bill is being interrogated and was asked "When did you shoot the clerk?" To which Bill replies " I shot the clerk?, I shot the clerk?"
        When the officer reads the statement in court he qutes Bill to have said "I shot the clerk. I shot the clerk."
      <h5>Ad Hoc Fallacy: Is when  person gives an explination for an event that is disputed by evidence and has to resort to utestable answers to salvage their claim.
        For example: Sally: "I just know James is just waiting to ask me out."
        Jenny: "He's dating Jessica, matter of fact he just proposed to her last night..."
        Sally: "Thats just his way of getting me to notice him"
        As we see in the example, Sally is making untestable and very disputable claims about James to rescue her original claim that they are to be together.
        <br>
        <h5>Ad Hominem Fallacy: This fallacy is an attack on the person insted of the arguement itself.
          It can call into question the person instead of the arguement. It is one I have had to defend on several times myself.
          For Example: Jacob: "We should raise funds to get the local high schools new science books. The books they have now are outdated."
          Joe: "You only want new science books becuase you spend more time in jail than in church, we should only consider your opinion for metal shop."
        <br>
        <h5>Appeal To Authority: Insisting the claim is true because someone with authority states it is true.
          For example: "My bishop told me that if I pray everyday for good health, I will never get sick. He's a bishop so he should know best."
        <h5>Appeal To Common Belief: When the claim that most people believe the claim, so therefore the claim must be true.
          For example: Greg: "I don't believe the whole virgin birth story.. I mean there is no solid evidence for it, and it's just a bit unbelievable."
          Jackie: "But there are billions of people that believe it... They all can't possibly be wrong, so you should rethink your stance on the matter just in case."</h5>
        <br>
        <h5>Appeal To Ignorance: This is where a person asserts an argument is true because it hasn't been proven false.
          For example: Samantha: "You cant prove that magical pixies don't exist so therefore they do exist"</h5>
